## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

**Folder Structure:**  
- `src/main/java/com/fynance` ‚Äì Core Java source code (UI, DAOs, models)  
- `src/main/resources` ‚Äì Configuration files (e.g., `config.properties`)  
- `pom.xml` ‚Äì Maven project configuration  


**Modules and Components:**  
- **UI (Swing):** Native desktop experience.  
  - `ExpenseAppGUI`: Main application window  
  - `GroupDetailsPanel`, `UserManagementPanel`: Specialized panels  
- **Data Access Objects (DAOs):** Abstract SQL queries from business logic  
- **Model Classes:** POJOs representing Users, Expenses, Groups, etc.  
- **Services:** `BalanceService`, `SettlementService` handle business logic  
- **Database:** MySQL to persist all data  

**Workflow:**  
1. User interacts with the Swing UI.  
2. UI calls DAO methods for data access or modifications.  
3. DAO executes SQL queries in MySQL.  
4. Data flows back to the UI for display.

## üöÄ Future Scope & Improvements
- **Multi-User Authentication:** Support multiple users on the same desktop.  
- **Cloud Sync:** Sync data across devices.  
- **Mobile App:** Companion app for on-the-go tracking.  
- **Advanced Analytics:** Trend analysis, forecasts, and reports.  
- **API Integrations:** REST API for third-party apps.

## üß© Current Issues & Challenges
- **Single User Focus:** User ID hardcoded.  
- **No Data Encryption:** Financial data stored without encryption.  
- **Limited Error Handling:** Needs user-friendly feedback.  
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Swing UI could be modernized.  

---

## ‚è≥ Past Challenges & Solutions
- **Complex SQL Queries:** Solved with `BalanceService` for structured calculations.  
- **UI Responsiveness:** Used `SwingWorker` to prevent UI freezing during DB operations.
